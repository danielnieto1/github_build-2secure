# Appdome Android Fuse&Sign action

Appdome's Build-2Secure GitHub Action is an out-of-the-box GitHub CI/CD integration, making it easy for mobile developers to automate the build, signing, and certification of security, anti-fraud, and other protections in Android & iOS apps in GitHub CI/CD pipelines. No code and no SDKs are required.

The purpose of Appdome's Build-2Secure Action for GitHub is to streamline and accelerate cyber and anti-fraud delivery in CI/CD pipelines. To do this, the Build-2Secure Action for GitHub automates three important steps in delivering more secure mobile applications to your users fast: (1) building app-level protections into mobile apps, (2) code signing the protected mobile app, and (3) certifying the security of each protected mobile app. The Appdome Build-2Secure Action for GitHub can be used to deliver Certified Secureâ„¢ mobile app security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, mobile anti-bot, and other cyber defense updates to mobile apps on the Appdome Cyber Defense Automation Platform. Use this Action for GitHub as a stand-alone DevSecOps integration or in combination with other DevSecOps integrations in your CI/CD pipeline.
